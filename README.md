## Getting Started


A to-do app, short for a to-do list application, is a software tool designed to help users organize and manage tasks or activities they need to accomplish. These apps are popular for personal and professional task management and are often used to improve productivity and organization. Here are some key features and components commonly found in to-do apps:

Task Entry:

Users can create tasks by entering a title or description of what needs to be done.
Some apps may allow users to set due dates, priorities, and categories for tasks.
Task List:

Tasks are typically displayed in a list format, making it easy for users to see what needs to be done.
The list may be organized by due date, priority, or other customizable criteria.
Task Details:

Users can usually view additional details about each task, such as due dates, notes, attachments, and subtasks.
